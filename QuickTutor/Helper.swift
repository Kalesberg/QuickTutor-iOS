Anyhow, the point is â Sam wasnât concentrating; and of course, as the story goes and as luck would have it, he had a paper due the next morning, based on todayâs class!\n\nInstead of freaking out: he does QuickTutor and chill. There he finds Jem. She knows a thing or two about Equity & Trusts. After only 45 minutes, Sam has gotten his head around the key concepts; so, Jem uses the remaining 15 minutes of their session to share with Sam another bit of wisdom â her spaghetti Bolognese recipe!\n\nThatâs the thing: with QuickTutor, you really can learn anything and teach anyone.

So, he logged into QuickTutor, and within minutes, he had scheduled a session with Pete. Now Sal's a bit obsessed (to put it politely) with Shakespeare and is even planning a trip to London to visit the Globe Theatre! Nice one, Sal. (Don't forget your toothbrush!).\n\nAs for Nidya, she considers herself a future Banksy. However, instead of getting in trouble with the 5-0 (as her folks weren't too keen on her using the exterior walls of the family crib either) she connected with Daniel. Daniel does one-on-one sessions at his studio and, as luck would have it, it's only a mile away from Nidya.\n\nDaniel earns some extra cash, and Nidya gets all the advice and blank surfaces an artist-in-the-making could need. We'll talk about Tommy another day (he's the actor who connects with an acting QuickTutor every time he has an audition. What a smart cookie!). Don't be shy.
